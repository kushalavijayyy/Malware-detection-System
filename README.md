# Malware-detection-System


---



This project is a simple malware detection system built with Python. It allows users to scan a directory for malware by checking files against known malware signatures. Suspicious files can be quarantined and the results are logged in a CSV file.

## Features

- **Directory Scanning:** Recursively scans all files within a specified directory.
- **Signature-Based Detection:** Compares file content against a list of known malware signatures.
- **Quarantine Option:** Prompts the user to quarantine suspicious files.
- **Logging:** Logs the paths of suspicious files and the detection time to a CSV file.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:** Execute the Python script to launch the GUI.
2. **Scan Directory:** Click the "Scan Directory" button and select the directory you want to scan.
3. **Quarantine Files:** If suspicious files are found, you'll be prompted to quarantine them.
4. **View Results:** The scan results will be displayed in the GUI and logged in `suspicious_files_log.csv`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- Pandas

## File Structure

- `malware_detection.py`: Main script for the malware detection system.
- `signatures.txt`: Text file containing malware signatures.
- `suspicious_files_log.csv`: Log file for suspicious files (generated after scanning).
- `quarantine/`: Directory where quarantined files are moved (created automatically if needed).

## Notes

- Ensure that `signatures.txt` is in the same directory as the script and contains the malware signatures you want to scan for.
- The quarantine directory is created in the current working directory.
